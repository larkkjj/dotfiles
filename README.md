Be sure to have Iosevka Nerd Font or any other Nerd Font for symbols.

## Install packages
If you're on Arch, you can simple run this and it will install all the stuff:
`yay -S starship fastfetch grim slurp fish aylur-gtk-shell hyprland ttf-fantasquesansm-nerd swww papirus-icon-theme kitty fuzzel git base-devel`

# (Optional) 
maybe there are some other dependencies like mpris, bluetooth, so if anything goes wrong, run this command too:
`sudo pacman -Syu upower networkmanager pipewire-pulse libdbusmenu-gtk3 ttf-hanazono gvfs xdg-user-dirs`

## Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/larkjkj/dotfiles/`

## Move the content from dotfiles to .config and delete the dotfiles folder
`mv ~/dotfiles ~/.config/`



Enjoy.
